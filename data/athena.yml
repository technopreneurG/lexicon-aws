  title:  Amazon Athena
  description:  Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to setup or manage, and you pay only for the queries you run. To get started, simply point to your data in S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL.
